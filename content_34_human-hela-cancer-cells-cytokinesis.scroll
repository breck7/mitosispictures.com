title Human HeLa cancer cells, cytokinesis
description A deconvolved wide-field fluorescence microscope image of human HeLa cancer cells undergoing cytokinesis (cell division). The chromosomes are red (DAPI stain for DNA). The microtubules of the cytoskeleton/spindle are purple, and the actin white. The green is Aurora B, a protein kinase involved in the polymerisation/depolymerisation of the microtubules during mitosis and cytokinesis.
