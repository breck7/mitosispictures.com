title Human HeLa cancer cell, metaphase.
description A deconvolved wide-field fluorescence microscope image of a human HeLa cancer cell in metaphase of mitosis. The chromosomes show whitish blue (DAPI stain for DNA). The microtubules of the cytoskeleton/spindle are blue. The green is Aurora B, a protein kinase involved in the polymerisation/depolymerisation of the microtubules during mitosis. The Red is CENP-F, an outer kinetochore protein that is important for mitosis.
