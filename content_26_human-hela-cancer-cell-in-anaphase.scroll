title Human HeLa cancer cell in anaphase
description A deconvolved wide-field fluorescence microscope image of a human HeLa cancer cell in anaphase of mitosis. The chromosomes are fluorescing blue, and the cytoskeleton microtubules green. The red is INCENP, a protein that regulates and targets Aurora B protein kinase, which is involved in the polymerisation /depolymerisation of microtubules during mitosis.
