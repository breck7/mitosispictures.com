title Human HeLa cancer cells, mitosis
description A deconvolved wide-field fluorescence microscope image of human HeLa cancer cells undergoing mitosis - various stages shown - bottom left, metaphase; top anaphase; bottom right telophase and far right early interphase. The chromosomes show up white with a DAPI stain. The cytoskeleton/spindle microtubules are blue/purple. The red is Aurora B, a protein kinase involved in the polymerisation/depolymerisation of microtubules during mitosis.
