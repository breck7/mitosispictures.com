title Human HeLa cancer cell, tripolar mitosis
description A deconvolved wide-field fluorescence microscope image of a human HeLa cancer cell undergoing aberrant mitosis - the spindle has three poles. The microtubules of the spindle show yellow. The purple is Aurora B, a protein kinase involved in the polymerisation/depolymerisation of the microtubules. The centromeres are blue.
